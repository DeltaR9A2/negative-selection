			<h2>The Observers</h2>
			<img class="illustration" src="images/basic_observer_bot.png">
			<p>Observers are ever-present in most regions. Some view them with suspicion while others revere them. They rove silently across the
				landscape, taking in every detail with their sensors. Nobody has been able to establish a clear pattern to their movements, but
				there are few places that don't see an observer at least once per month, and they are daily visitors in most settlements.</p>
			<p>Imperial doctrine holds that observers are the eyes and ears of the gods. They watch over humanity for signs of sin or corruption,
				summoning punishment as necessary. All citizens are required to maintain a respectful distance from any obervers they encounter.
				It is considered a crime to strike an observer or to obstruct its movement in any way. </p>
